Essentially, you read a paragraph that describes you current situation, and then you decide which page to jump to based on what decision you want to make.  When you turn to the next page, you repeat the process! For example, below is a page from a make-your-own-adventure book.

For example, below is a sample text adventure story I've made. Each box represents a page/situation, and lines between boxes represent actions that you can take to go between pages. The story starts at the top, in 'You are in a hallway with a left and right door'. Read the following diagram, and then answer the following questions about it.
