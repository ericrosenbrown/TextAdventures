    "For our text adventure code, we use functions to define each of our pages. The indented code in each function defintion seperates each page code. Right above question 5 in this tutorial, all of our page functions are defined and ready to go. However, since we've defined all of our pages, we need to run one of them to start the game! Because start_game() is the name of the function that represents the first page, we can simply call the function after we've defined all of our pages. Thus, in the completed game code, we define all of the functions, and then call start_game() so that when you run the code-block, the game begins. Without calling start_game() at the bottom, all of our functions would be defined, but nothing would happen. (Remember that start_game() is just an arbitrary name for the function that represents the first page. We could have named it in_hallway() or anything else, as long as it doesn't overlap in name with another function)."
